### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

An enthusiastic and results-oriented team player with an extensive academic background in geoscience and Environment. I am currently pursiuing my MSc studies at [Julius-Maximilians-UniversitÃ¤t of WÃ¼rzburg (JMU)](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/) in [Applied Earth Observation and Geoanalysis (EAGLE)](http://eagle-science.org/). My main activities on Github involve in the practical applications of remote sensig using geospatial analysis and Machine learning. I started my coding journey using R and over time I gravitaed toward python. 
I make sure to provide valuable contribution and technical insights to the organizations I am part of. I also have experience in working in multi-disciplinary team of engineers and scientists.
