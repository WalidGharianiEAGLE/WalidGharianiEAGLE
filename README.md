### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

An enthusiastic and results-oriented team player with an extensive academic and professional background in Earth Observation and Geoscience and Environmental engineering. Recently I graduated with MSc in [Applied Earth Observation and Geoanalysis (EAGLE)](http://eagle-science.org/) from [Julius-Maximilians-UniversitÃ¤t of WÃ¼rzburg (JMU)](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/). My main activities on Github involve in the practical applications of remote sensing using geospatial analysis and Machine learning. I started my coding journey using R and over time I gravitated toward python. 
I make sure to provide valuable contribution and technical insights to the organizations I am part of. I am excited about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems and drive impactful decision-making.
